</div>

PokeTokenBar turns the AI coding tokens you're already burning — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI & Pi Agent — into a growing **Pokémon companion** in your macOS menu bar. Spend tokens, hatch an egg, evolve it through its real evolution line, graduate it into your Pokédex, and start again. Underneath the companion it's a precise usage tracker — today's spend, cost, and official 5-hour / weekly limits, read straight from your local logs.

> Token usage is read directly from local Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI, and Pi Agent data (`totalTokens` = input + output + cache, local date) — no external CLI needed. Unofficial, non-commercial Pokémon fan project — see [License & disclaimer](#license--disclaimer).

## Why

- **The usage tracker you actually enjoy opening.** Your spend raises a Pokémon that hatches, evolves, graduates, and fills a Pokédex — and every shiny is a reason to check back.
- See today's token spend & cost at a glance — no dashboard, no browser tab.
- Track official **5-hour / weekly** limits with reset countdowns and a burn-rate forecast for when you'll hit them.

</div>

## How it works

1. 🥚 **Code as usual.** The tokens you burn in Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI, or Pi Agent incubate an egg — nothing extra to run.
2. 🐣 **Hatch.** Eggs hatch into Pokémon with real evolution lines from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) — any Gen 1–5 line (329 possible starts), weighted by the official capture rate: commons hatch often, a legendary is a 1-in-129 event. It appears in your **Pokédex** immediately while you raise it. Every hatch rolls one of 25 natures — and once in a rare while, the egg hatches **✨ Shiny**.
3. ⚡ **Evolve.** Keep coding and it grows through its actual evolution tree (1/2/3 stages, branching), with a little flash celebration at each step.
4. 🎓 **Graduate & collect.** Final form + threshold permanently archives it in your **Pokédex** — rarer takes longer (≈3 days common → ≈24 days legendary at heavy use) — and a fresh egg arrives.
5. 🍬 **Max out, get a candy.** Fill a 5-hour or weekly usage limit and you earn **Rare Candy** — spend it from the **Bag** to grow your current Pokémon.
6. 🛒 **Spend at the Shop.** Every token you've used is spendable currency — buy **Rare Candy**, a **Mint** that re-rolls your Pokémon's nature, a **Shiny Charm** that permanently raises your shiny odds, or an egg to send off your current companion and start over. Eggs come in three grades: a plain **Pokémon Egg**, an **Uncommon Egg** guaranteed to hatch Uncommon or better, and a **Rare Egg** guaranteed to hatch Rare or better.

## Also in the box

- **Representative Pokémon** — pin any owned Pokédex species to the menu bar and optional floating pet, independently of the companion you're raising. While pinned, the menu bar stops following egg, hatch, and evolution changes; raising progress remains visible on Home.
- **Interactive floating pet** — hover for today's usage, click to open the main window, right-click for a menu, and show limit alerts as speech bubbles.
- **Per-service tabs** — when two or more of Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI, and Pi Agent are detected, compact tabs switch between them; today's total stays combined.
- **Official limits** — Claude, Codex & Antigravity 5-hour / weekly utilization with reset countdowns, right under today's numbers.
- **Additional scan folders** — per-provider extra scan roots for logs kept outside the built-in paths (Settings → Advanced).
- **Burn-rate forecast** — projects when the current 5h window hits 100%.
- **In-app updates** — one-click update check; current version shown in Settings.

All read locally — no external usage CLI required. Adding a tool is one provider file (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

## Install

### Requirements

macOS 14+ (Apple Silicon or Intel). That's it — token usage is read directly from local Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI, and Pi Agent data, with no external usage CLI required.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask chattymin/tap/poke-token-bar
```

ad-hoc/self-signed; the cask strips the quarantine attribute on install.

### Manual install (without Homebrew)

Prefer not to use Homebrew? Download `PokeTokenBar.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/chattymin/PokeTokenBar/releases/latest), unzip it, and drag `PokeTokenBar.app` into `/Applications`.

Because the app is ad-hoc/self-signed (not notarized under an Apple Developer account), Gatekeeper shows an "unidentified developer" warning on first launch. Clear it once, either way:

- **Finder:** right-click (or Control-click) `PokeTokenBar.app` → **Open** → **Open** again in the dialog.
- **Terminal:** `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PokeTokenBar.app`

(The Homebrew cask strips quarantine for you, so it needs no extra step.)

### Build from source

```bash
swift build                  # debug
swift test                   # unit tests
./scripts/build-app.sh       # release → PokeTokenBar.app → /Applications
```

### Kubernetes remote usage (experimental)

If Claude Code or Codex runs inside a Kubernetes pod, mirror its usage into a local scan folder:

```bash
./scripts/sync-k8s-claude.sh --pod my-pod --configure --retain-days 90
./scripts/sync-k8s-codex.sh  --pod my-pod --configure --retain-days 90
```

Only the records the parsers read are rebuilt field by field **inside the pod** — prompts, tool output and file contents never leave it, and a 23 MB session crosses as 23 KB. The pod can be set with `--pod`; the default is `<local-user>-0`. The other defaults are the current kubectl context's namespace, container `workspace`, and remote paths `/root/.claude` and `/root/.codex`. `--retain-days` bounds the mirror by deleting older mirrored sessions (Codex keeps fork ancestors regardless of age); without it the mirror keeps the pod's full history. `jq` must be present in the pod. See `--help` for every flag and environment override, and [`docs/reference/k8s-remote-usage.md`](docs/reference/k8s-remote-usage.md) for the measurements, scheduling and troubleshooting. Restart PokeTokenBar after the first `--configure`.

Official 5-hour/weekly limits are account-level, so pod usage already counts toward them without any syncing.

## Data sources

| Source | Used for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` | Claude Code daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | read directly; deduped by message id; cached incrementally |
| `~/.gemini/tmp/**/chats/*.json(l)` | Gemini CLI daily/monthly | session records (`tokens` per message); weekly = daily sum |
| `~/.gemini/antigravity/conversations/*.db`<br>`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/*.db`<br>`~/.gemini/antigravity-ide/conversations/*.db` | Antigravity daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | SQLite read-only; per-call usage from the Cascade protobuf blob; supports Antigravity 2.0/Core, CLI & IDE; its own provider, not folded into Gemini; a subscription, so no cost is estimated |
| `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | Codex daily/monthly | `token_count` events; weekly = daily sum |
| `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` | OpenCode daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | SQLite read-only; legacy `storage/message` JSON is also supported |
| `~/.hermes/state.db` | Hermes Agent daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | SQLite read-only; session token totals and persisted cost |
| `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` | Cursor daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | SQLite read-only; `cursorDiskKV` bubble entries with `tokenCount` |
| `~/.grok/sessions/**/updates.jsonl` | Grok CLI daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | `turn_completed` records (per-turn `usage`, server-reported cost); honours `$GROK_HOME`; subagent sessions are skipped because their tokens are already folded into the parent turn |
| `~/.copilot/session-store.db` | Copilot CLI daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | SQLite read-only; one `assistant_usage_events` row per API call; honours `$COPILOT_HOME`; `input_tokens` already contains the cached prompt, so cache reads/writes are subtracted; premium-request billing, so no cost is estimated |
| `~/Library/Application Support/kiro-cli/data.sqlite3` | Kiro CLI daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | SQLite read-only; conversation history JSON (`conversations`/`conversations_v2`); Kiro's local database never records real token counts, and there is no server-side session, so input is a bytes÷4 **estimate** of the accumulated conversation text resent on every turn (output likewise from the real streamed response size); a `/clear`d or compacted conversation's already-counted tokens stay counted until the app restarts; no cost is estimated |
| `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl` | Pi Agent daily/blocks/weekly/monthly | Direct persisted usage from all projects; `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and `$PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` overrides supported; output already includes reasoning (not counted twice); forked history deduplicated by entry ID; no cost is reported |
| Keychain / `~/.claude/.credentials.json` → `api.anthropic.com` | Claude official 5h/weekly % | unofficial endpoint; the Keychain is read **only when you press refresh** — auto-polling never reads it |
| `codex app-server` | Codex official 5h/weekly % | local child process; account snapshot only, no model turn |
| [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) — `pokeapi.co`, `graphql.pokeapi.co` | Pokémon species &amp; evolution | runtime fetch; cached locally, never bundled |
| `raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites` | Pokémon &amp; item sprites | runtime fetch; cached under Application Support, never bundled |
| `status.claude.com`, `status.openai.com` | provider incident banner | statuspage summary; display only — turn it off in Settings |
| `api.github.com` | update check | latest release tag; on launch and when the popover opens |

If a provider's logs live **outside** those built-in paths, add the folder in **Settings → Advanced → Additional scan folders**. Pick the provider first — each folder is parsed only by that provider, so pointing a Gemini field at Claude logs would mis-attribute tokens. Extra folders are added to the built-in locations; they never replace them.

## Privacy & permissions

- **On-device.** Token usage is read directly from local Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Hermes Agent, Cursor, Grok CLI, Copilot CLI, Kiro CLI, and Pi Agent data. The app never uploads usage or runs model turns.
- **Outbound requests.** The app is not fully offline. It talks to ten hosts: `pokeapi.co` and `graphql.pokeapi.co` (species/evolution), `raw.githubusercontent.com` (sprites), `api.anthropic.com` (Claude official limits), `cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` and `daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` (Antigravity official limits) plus `oauth2.googleapis.com` (their token refresh), `status.claude.com` and `status.openai.com` (incident banner — off switch in Settings), and `api.github.com` (update check). **None of them carry your usage, tokens, prompts, or project paths** — only the request itself.
- **Keychain (optional).** The Claude OAuth credential is read **only when you press a refresh button** (Settings, or the limits row in the popover). Automatic polling never touches the Keychain, so it never raises a password prompt; when available, the credential is taken from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` instead. The token is held in memory only — the app creates no Keychain item of its own. Once the token expires, limits stay visible but stale until you refresh. Turn it off in Settings — the limits section simply hides.
- **Pokémon assets** are fetched at runtime from PokéAPI and cached only under `~/Library/Application Support/PokeTokenBar/`. The app binary and its release artifacts contain no Pokémon assets.
